EcoApp
- It is not always big actions that make big changes. Small actions done consistently make big changes too. This app is an attempt to do the same by increasing participation and awareness of the public for a better and healthier environment. EcoApp is primarily focused on but not limited to, environment.

- The app will give a challenge a day to the users which they can easily complete in day's time.
- They are required to post a little picture of their task which they can share with on various social media platforms.

Work in progress

- Videos and quizzes about environment
- Tracking daily progress through streaks
- Creating a leaderboard
